# Machine-Learning-for-Solar-Energy-Prediction

### Project Overview
A machine learning project for predicting solar panel farm power production based on weather data. Developed to explore ML techniques like PCA, neural networks, and boosting. The goal of the project is to predict the hourly power production of a photovoltaic power station from the measurements of a set of weather features.

### Features
- Weather and power data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (correlation analysis, PCA)  
- Model comparisons (linear regression, boosting, neural networks)  
- Multi-language support: Python, R, MATLAB  

### Changelog
- **v1.0**: Initial release with model and report files.

### Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repo: `git clone <repo_link>`  
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

### Usage Guide
- Preprocess datasets via the scripts in `/Data Processing`.
- Perform dimensions reduction via the script `/Principal Component Analysis`   
- Train models using `/Random Forest`, `/Recurrent Neural Networks`.
